👋 Hi! I'm Razec,a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology sophomore who's deeply immersed in the fascinating realm of coding. I'm always eager to learn and broaden my horizons.

## 🌱 2024 Goals
[putting this here up to push myself to accomplish these goals!]
- **Create 12 Projects!** :  may it be acad/personal project, I will create 12 programming projects!
- **Learn more about AI's** : just diving more into ai, as it will surely be benificial in the future.
- **Land an internship** : building resume, portfolio are included here which wound't be easy but really.. * * Manifesting * *
- **Master DSA and OOP** : the earlier the better! these are a must!!!

## 🧒 About Me!!
I'd say that this course was never my dream course. Actually, when I was a kid, I dreamt about being an astronaut travelling through space and time 🌌🚀 seeing aliens 👽. Dream? Hmm... I had no idea what I wanted back then but suddenly I got fascinated about the world of technology. I started diving through web development specifically html and css, then entered different rabbit holes 🕳️, being lost and tryna find my way outta space.. Long story short, I'm here pulling myself up and getting back on track following such roadmaps I'm unsure where I'll end up. (Also alongside with that, here's my school acting up a storm drowning me with acads stuffs😭. But Hey! One thing's for sure. I'll get back on track this Christmas Break, Semestral Break and ANY TYPES OF BREAK!!! Enough with the drama 😆, Lez Move Forward⏩!!

## 🎯 Interests
I enjoy watching videos on a variety of topics, especially day in a life of a programmer!!🎥. I also have a curious mind that loves delving into theories - be it related to tech or any other field. 📚
Yes, I do tend to procrastinate sometimes (I mean... who doesn't?), but yeahh, I'm working onnit! 😅

## 👯 Collaborations
I’m always excited to collaborate on projects, especially those related to Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis/Science!
Please keep in mind that I only have the fundamental foundation in these areas, I consider myself a lifelong learner. I’m always eager to learn more and improve my skills. So, let’s learn and grow together! 🚀
