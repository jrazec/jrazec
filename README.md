👋 Hi! I'm Razec,a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology sophomore who's deeply immersed in the fascinating realm of coding. I'm always eager to learn and broaden my horizons.

## 🌱 2024 Goals
[putting this here up to push myself to accomplish these goals!]
- **Create Projects!** :  may it be acad/personal project, I will continuosly create programming projects!
- **Learn more about AI's** : just diving more into ai, as it will surely be benificial in the future.
- **Acquire more knowledge** : building resume, portfolio are included here which wound't be easy but really.. * * Manifesting * *
- **Study DSA and OOP moree** : the earlier the better! these are a must!!!

## 🧒 About Me!!
I'd say that this course was never my dream course. Actually, when I was a kid, I dreamt about being an astronaut travelling through space and time 🌌🚀 seeing aliens 👽. Dream? Hmm... I had no idea what I wanted back then but suddenly I got fascinated about the world of technology. I started diving through web development specifically html and css, then entered different rabbit holes 🕳️, being lost and tryna find my way outta space.. Long story short, I'm here pulling myself up and getting back on track following such roadmaps I'm unsure where I'll end up. (Also alongside with that, here's my school acting up a storm drowning me with acads stuffs😭. But Hey! One thing's for sure. I'll get back on track this Christmas Break, Semestral Break and ANY TYPES OF BREAK!!! Enough with the drama 😆, Lez Move Forward⏩!!

## 📚Courseworks
Here are a few IT related subjects I already took:
- **Computer Programming 1**: Learned the basics of C++ where we used CodeChum as our learning environment. Here's the start of my programming journey which I began to learn all the programming fundamentals.
- Data Structures and Algorithms: Along with the ComProg 1, I've learned what are the data structures available to use such as arrays, linked lists, trees as well as such algorithms(linear search, bubble sort etc.)
- **Computer Programming 2**: Learned a new language which is C++ where we built some windows form applications.
- **Database Management System**: Discovered a new programming language(Postgresql) which specializes in storing, manipulating, and performing CRUD processes. One of the subjects that I'd say ignited my passion for programming as I saw a different field of IT. I was immersed with creating ERD for database, their relationships, normalization processes, and querying.
- **Advanced Database Management System**: I just finished this course recently and I'd say I learned a lot especially through database management. Going through advanced Querying(e.g. subqueries, window functions etc.), database transactions, and also a sprinkle of database security.
 
## 🛠 Skills
Here are some skills I acquired in the past years: 🔭
- **C++ Basics**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Git and GitHub**
- **Python Basics**
- **C#: Windows Form**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MySQL**
- **Linux Terminal**:

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Recently,here's what I'm focusing on:

PLs:
- **Python**: Exploring the versatility of this powerful language, which I'll try to focus onto. 🧑‍💻
- **Javascript**: Also tryna deep dive into the realm of js

## 📚 Future Learning Goals
After wrapping up this semester, I plan to delve into:

- **Python Libraries**
- **AI and Machine Learning**
- **MongoDB**
- **Continue my The Odin Project Journey!!**

## 🎯 Interests
I enjoy watching videos on a variety of topics, especially day in a life of a programmer!!🎥. I also have a curious mind that loves delving into theories - be it related to tech or any other field. 📚
Yes, I do tend to procrastinate sometimes (I mean... who doesn't?), but yeahh, I'm working onnit! 😅

## 👯 Collaborations
I’m always excited to collaborate on projects, especially those related to Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis/Science!
Please keep in mind that I only have the fundamental foundation in these areas, I consider myself a lifelong learner. I’m always eager to learn more and improve my skills. So, let’s learn and grow together! 🚀
