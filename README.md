👋 Hi! I'm Razec,a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology sophomore who's deeply immersed in the fascinating realm of coding. I'm always eager to learn and broaden my horizons.


## 🧒 About Me!!
I'd say that this course was never my dream course. Actually, when I was a kid, I dreamt about being an astronaut travelling through space and time 🌌🚀 seeing aliens 👽. Dream? Hmm... I had no idea what I wanted back then but suddenly I got fascinated about the world of technology. I started diving through web development specifically html and css, then entered different rabbit holes 🕳️, being lost and tryna find my way outta space.. Long story short, I'm here pulling myself up and getting back on track following such roadmaps I'm unsure where I'll end up. (Also alongside with that, here's my school acting up a storm drowning me with acads stuffs😭. But Hey!One thing's for sure. I'll get back on track this Christmas Break, Semestral Break and ANY TYPES OF BREAK!!! Enough with the drama 😆, Lez Move Forward⏩!!


## 🛠 Skills
Here are some skills I acquired in the past years: 🔭
- **C++ Basics**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

- **Google Sheets and Excel**: Trying to start learning these useful/must have skillsets! 🧑‍💻
- **Linux**: Just gonna add this one 😆, tryna "master" this OS or should I say be more comfortable with its feels and the most powerful BASHH!!🧑‍💻
##
- **Java**: Grasping the fundamentals of this language, we are using in our OOP Subject!📚
- **SQL(Postgresql)**: Unraveling the marvellous world of databases!!📚
- **C#**: Windows Form induced, learning more about programming in a different way/perspective... 📚


I'm also learning how to interact with AI models like ChatGPT. 🤖 **GPT Prompting!**

## 📚 Future Learning Goals
After wrapping up this semester, I plan to delve into:

- **Python Libraries**
- **Advanced Database**
- **AI and Machine Learning**
- **Continue my TOP Journey!!**


## 🎯 Interests
I enjoy watching videos on a variety of topics, especially data science and analysis🎥. I also have a curious mind that loves delving into theories - be it related to tech or any other field. 📚
Yes, I do tend to procrastinate sometimes (I mean... who doesn't?), but yeahh, I'm working onnit! 😅

## 👯 Collaborations
I’m always excited to collaborate on projects, especially those related to Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis/Science!
Please keep in mind that I only have the fundamental foundation in these areas, I consider myself a lifelong learner. I’m always eager to learn more and improve my skills. So, let’s learn and grow together! 🚀
